hgr export for 3dsmax, version 2.9.8
------------------------------------


Supported 3dsmax versions
-------------------------

3dsmax 7.0: hgrexport-max7.dle
3dsmax 8.0: hgrexport-max7.dle


Install
-------

1) Copy -maxX version specific plugin to 
   3dsmaxX\plugins directory
   
2) Copy DevIL.dll (image loading library) to PATH, e.g.
   C:\windows\system32 directory.


Overview
--------

hgrexport is export class plugin for 3dsmax.
It writes scene hierarchy, geometry, materials and 
key framed animations to single scene hgr file.


Export dialog
-------------

Parse IDs from names:
- Parses three first characters as a number from node name,
  and sets the number as node user ID. For example,
  object named "501 My Car" would be set user ID of 501.
  If this flag is set, then error is set if parsing fails.
  (if this flag is not set and name prefix matches,
  the ID is set anyway but no error is raised if ID missing)

Scale world units to meters:
- Scales temporarily all objects to metric system

Copy textures to output path:
- Copies textures used in the scene to the same 
  directory where the scene file is exported

Animation only:
- Export only animation data. Useful mainly with character animations.

Animation sample rate (Hz):
- Defines initial sampling rate for key frame transformation animation 
  data. After this initial sampling, the data is optimized.

Default shaders:
- Default shaders can be assigned by material channel usage,
  so that different channel combinations can be assigned 
  different shaders. Good for 'random scenes' which don't
  have shaders assigned (using DirectX 9 Shader material)
  
Fog checkbox:
- Linear fog enabled/disabled

Fog start distance:
- Linear fog start distance relative to camera. Can be negative.

Fog end distance:
- Linear fog maximum distance relative to camera.

Lightmaps, Direct lLighting:
- Bake direct lighting to lightmaps. 
  Can be combined with 'Ambient occlusion'.

Lightmaps, Ambient occlusion:
- Bake ambient occlusion factor to lightmaps. 
  Can be combined with 'Direct Lighting'.
  
Lightmaps, Unoccluded distance:
- Distance which is consider unoccluded by the 
  ambient occlusion factor ray-tracing.
  
Lightmaps, Texel size:
- Size of single lightmap texel in world space coordinates
  (smaller texel in world space -> more lightmap data)

Lightmaps, Rays / texel:
- Number of rays used to find out ambient occlusion factor


Lightmaps
---------

Lightmapping, when enabled, is done by default to all objects.

Lightmapping can be disable per-object basis by
setting 'Receive shadows' check box disabled from
'Edit -> Object Properties'.

If object is not supposed to cast shadow then disable
'Cast shadows' check box from 'Edit -> Object Properties'.


Normal mapping
--------------

Be sure that your normal maps axis matches
engine/3dsmax conventions. If you create normal maps
from height maps with NVidia Photoshop plugin,
you need to 'Invert Y' option.


Position, rotation and scale animations
---------------------------------------

Transformation animations are extracted by re-sampling,
so any controller can be used to animate objects.


Skinned characters
------------------

Character skinning information is extracted both from 
Character Studio Physique modifier and 3dsmax Skin modifier.


Materials, shaders and lights
-----------------------------

Preferred way to set materials to objects is to
use 'DirectX 9 Shader' material type in 3dsmax.
Standard material is also supported as legacy option.

Multi-Sub Object Material is also supported when
multiple DX Materials / Standard materials are needed
to be used in one object. So each exported object must 
use either DX Material, Standard material or 
Multi-Sub Object material, which has DX/Standard materials
as sub materials.


3dsmax Standard Material specific issues
----------------------------------------

Note: These issues are ONLY concern to you if you use
Standard Material in 3dsmax. Preferred way is to use
'DirectX 9 Shader' material type.

Shaders can be set to Standard material either by
a) Setting default shaders in export dialog
b) FX=<shader name> tag in material name

Default shaders can be assigned by material channel
usage type, so that different channel combinations
can be assigned different shaders.

Tag on the other hand is material specific in its name.
For example 'Default 1 FX=bump' is valid material name 
using bump shader tag. Various parameters from Standard
Material interface are exported, see individual 
shader files for details.

Map channels don't bind shader any way how the shader
can use the data channels; it is free to interpret the data 
any way it wants. This might be a bit confusing at first
since there is two concepts which are kind of independent 
of each other: 

One thing is that what information is exported and 
one thing is what the shaders assume from the input. For
example currently all bump shaders assume that only Diffuse,
Specular Level and Bump maps are in use, and that Diffuse 
map alpha channel contains per pixel specular glossiness,
and normal map alpha channel contains either transparency or
self-illumination -information, depending on shader.
However, each shader is plain text file and has documented list
of parameters and how they are used, so from each shader
you can check which 3dsmax map channels are needed.

Note also that when using 3dsmax Standard Material
and Bitmap channels, you CANNOT use UV Cropping/Tiling
parameters which can be set in the Bitmap rollout.
The exporter will give you an error message if the values
are not in default settings.


Lights
------

Following light properties are exported each light
(shader parameter name in parenthesis):
- Light Color (as LIGHTC)
- Light Position (as LIGHTP)

Light numbering (e.g. LIGHTC0-7) is not based on 3dsmax objects, 
but object approximity with the light instead. So for example 
LIGHTC0 is always the color of the closest light, and LIGHTC1 
is always the color of the second closest light if any, etc.


Fog
---

Fog is used in the scene if the 'Fog enabled' check box in the exporter
dialog is checked as well while exporting the level. Note that you only need
to enable the fog for the main level scene, e.g. separately exported
characters don't need fog to be set, since only the level file scene fog
settings are used.

Fog uses 3dsmax Rendering -> Environment -> Background Color as fog color
(there is also a comment about it in Exporter dialog box), and fog range is
defined in the Exporter dialog. Fog is always linear, since its easier to
control. Fog range on the other hand is not limited, in other words you can
set fog start behind camera to create more subtle effect.

Note that all export dialog options are saved next to target exported file,
for example exported scene.hgr would have export config saved as
scene.hgr.cfg, so you need to set them only once, and you can also check
afterwards from the plain text cfg file which settings were used)

Fog is independent of material. Only exception is unlit-tex-nofog shader,
which ignores fog totally (it was done for skydome). Other nofog shaders can
be easily added as well if needed.


Known issues
------------

- Some plugins do not seem to cope well with 'Scale world units to meters' 
  functionality -- you'll notice if this happens (scene 'explodes'
  after export)
