0) You need to have DirectX 9.0c installed, msdn.microsoft.com/directx

1) You also need DirectX Pixel Shader 1.1 compatible display adapter,
   e.g. GF4 (not MX!) or better

2) Unpack shaders-1.4.2.zip to C:\ka3d\shaders,
   so that shaders' readme.txt is in C:\ka3d\shaders\readme.txt

3) Set environment variable KA3D=C:\ka3d

4) Unpack hgrviewer-1.4.1.zip to C:\ka3d\hgrviewer

5) Test that the sceneviewer works, start it from hgrviewer directory
   and load scene from zax_exported/ directory. If you see walking
   character on screen (see screenshots/), then it works.

6) Unpack correct 3dsmax plugin (hgrexport-max6 preferred)
   from 3dsmax-hgrexport-1.4.1.zip to your 3dsmax directory, e.g.
   C:\3dsmax6\plugins

7) Use 'DirectX Shader' material type when you create materials
   for objects.  The other option is to use Standard Material,
   but it's less flexible.

8) Use C:\ka3d\shaders\character\s-bump.fx shader for the character
   and C:\ka3d\shaders\level\s-bump.fx shader for the level
   (notice that the shader uses diffuse map's alpha channel for glossiness)

9) Browse *.txt docs included in the zips, they contain more info
   if you're interested to take a look.
