# Ka3D

- Ka3D is a game engine and framework written in C++, formerly developed by Pixelgene. The codebase makes it easy to port to other platform.
- The release by Kajala only includes DirectX 9 rendering.
- You are free to fork this repo, port it to other platform and make a PR.

Modified to also support modern development environments and locally installed DirectX SDK, samples and executables do not currently build with the latest build tools.
