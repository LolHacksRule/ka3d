# Ka3D

- Ka3D is a game engine and framework written in C++, formerly developed by Pixelgene. The codebase makes it easy to port to other platform.
- The release by Kajala only includes DirectX 9 rendering.
- You are free to fork this repo, port it to other platform and make a PR.

Modified to also support modern development environments and locally installed DirectX SDK, all libraries and almost all applications build but you may get an error when running samples and tutorials after building using the latest build tools.
